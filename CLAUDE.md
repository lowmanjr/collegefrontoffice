# CollegeFrontOffice.com — Master Architecture Document

## Current Status (April 2026)
- **68 Power 4 teams**, 12,838 players, 4,971 valued
- **Pipeline order**: ESPN rosters → On3 transfer portal → Ourlads depth charts → valuations
- ESPN sync runs first (base truth), On3 portal sync runs second (catches recent transfers ESPN missed)
- Transfer portal scraper: sync_transfer_portal.py (On3, paginated, 5,432 committed entries)
- Texas comparison CSV workflow in progress — user pastes On3 data, script generates CSV with CFO vs On3 valuations, user fills Override Value column
- Methodology page cleaned (no EA Sports, no On3, no "verified" language)
- All UI pages use slug-based URLs, compact currency for team totals, full precision for player valuations

## 1. Project Overview
College Front Office is a data dashboard and valuation tool for the modern college sports economy. It aggregates player data across all 68 Power 4 programs (SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, and Notre Dame), calculates a proprietary "C.F.O. Valuation" for college athletes and elite HS recruits, and tracks team-level roster composition and estimated roster value.

## 2. Tech Stack
* **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **UI Components:** shadcn/ui, recharts (for charts)
* **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* **Hosting:** Vercel
* **Data Pipeline:** Python (pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup) → Supabase API (service role)
* **Testing:** Vitest (TypeScript, 134 tests), pytest (Python, 131 tests) — 265 total

## 3. Valuation Engine
**The canonical valuation engine specification lives in `VALUATION_ENGINE.md`. All valuation logic must conform to that document.**

The active engine is **V3.5** (`python_engine/calculate_cfo_valuations.py`). All prior versions (V1–V3.4) are superseded.

### V3.5 Changes (April 2026)
- **Position base value recalibration:** QB $850K→$1.2M, OT $550K→$800K, WR $400K→$550K, etc. All positions increased ~27% to match 2025-26 market data.
- **2028 HS experience fix:** Multiplier for 2028 juniors reduced from 0.70→0.35, 2029+ from 0.65→0.25. Fixes 4.6× On3 overvaluation for young QBs.
- **EA rating fallback in talent_modifier:** Priority chain: production_score → ea_rating → star_rating. EA OVR tiers: 90+→1.4, 82+→1.2, 75+→1.0, 68+→0.65, <68→0.4
- **Recruiting pedigree floor:** 5★ class ≤ 3 → depth chart multiplier floor of 1.0×. 4★ class ≤ 3 → floor of 0.45×.
- **TE is a 2-starter position** (changed from 1 in V3.4). TE2 gets 1.0× instead of 0.35×.
- **New column:** `players.ea_rating` (INTEGER) — EA Sports CFB 26 OVR rating

Two formula paths:
- **College Athlete Formula** — production/draft-based model with position-aware depth chart rank multiplier
- **High School Recruit Formula** — composite-score-based model for 4★ and 5★ HS recruits

Key algorithm files:
- `VALUATION_ENGINE.md` — canonical spec (internal, do not share publicly)
- `python_engine/calculate_cfo_valuations.py` — Python batch engine (both paths)
- `python_engine/supabase_client.py` — shared Supabase service-role client
- `lib/valuation.ts` — TypeScript mirror for server-side breakdown rendering

## 6. Coding Guidelines for Claude
* Always use TypeScript for Next.js components.
* Default to server components unless interactivity (useState, onClick) is required.
* Do not invent data; rely on the schema provided.
* Keep components modular (e.g., separate the `PlayerTable` from the `CapSpaceBar`).
* Import `formatCurrency` from `lib/utils.ts` for player-level values (full precision).
* Import `formatCompactCurrency` from `lib/utils.ts` for team-level aggregates (e.g. "$29.8M").
* Import `positionBadgeClass` from `lib/ui-helpers.ts` for position badge color coding.
* Import `BASE_URL` from `lib/constants.ts` for canonical URLs and structured data.
* Use `<PlayerAvatar>` from `components/PlayerAvatar.tsx` for player headshots with initials fallback.
* All valuation math must use `lib/valuation.ts` (TypeScript) or `calculate_cfo_valuations.py` (Python). Do not implement valuation logic inline.
* Routes use slugs, not UUIDs: `/players/[slug]` and `/teams/[slug]`.
* The `/futures` route has been renamed to `/recruits` with a permanent redirect.
* 2026 HS recruits are merged into team active rosters (post national signing day).
* 2027/2028 commits do NOT appear on team pages.
* Team logos use ESPN CDN format: `https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/{espn_id}.png`
* Player headshots use ESPN CDN: `https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/college-football/players/full/{espn_id}.png&w=200&h=146`
* Recruit headshots come from 247Sports (scraped via `scrape_247_headshots.py`).
* All composite scores are on the 0-100 scale (not 0-1).
* Do not display "247Sports" branding on player-facing pages.
* Run `npm test` (Vitest) and `cd python_engine && python -m pytest tests/ -v` after valuation changes.

## 7. Page Structure

| Route | What It Shows | Data Source |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `/` (Homepage) | Hero search + route cards (Teams, Players, Recruits) | Static |
| `/players` (Big Board) | Top 100 college athletes by valuation | players + teams join |
| `/players/[slug]` (Player Profile) | Name, avatar, team, valuation; override contract details; recruit profile card | players + teams + nil_overrides |
| `/recruits` | 4/5★ HS recruits by composite score, filtered by class year | players + teams join |
| `/teams` (Team Index) | Programs ranked by Est. Roster Value | team_roster_summary view |
| `/teams/[slug]` (Team Detail) | Active roster + 2026 recruits merged, sorted by valuation | players + teams |
| `/methodology` | Static content explaining valuation approach | Static JSX |

## 8. SEO

* All pages have canonical URLs via `alternates.canonical` (using `BASE_URL` from `lib/constants.ts`).
* Dynamic sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` includes all teams and all public players (paginated).
* JSON-LD structured data: Person (player profiles), SportsTeam (team profiles), ItemList (index pages).
* Dynamic OG images for player profiles and team profiles.
* Static OG image for homepage.
* Apple touch icon and web manifest at `/apple-icon` and `/manifest.webmanifest`.
* `robots.txt` blocks `/admin`, `/login`, `/auth`.
* Permanent redirect: `/futures` → `/recruits`.
